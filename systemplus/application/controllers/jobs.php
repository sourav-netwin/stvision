However that couldnt be further from what happened!To begin with, Tiziano from the office replied to us via email within a week of us putting in our request for our holiday, and was extremely helpful and flexible with the dates which was much appreciated.We stayed at Residence \"Nettuno\" at Capo 'd Orlando, Sicily.<br/>As soon as we got there we were welcomed by Alessandro, who runs the resort, and Eliza who was in reception, and we have never felt more comfortable and relaxed as we did there! They both made us feel very welcome and at home.<br/>Alessandro escorted us to our apartment which was with an amazing beach/ocean view, and he explained everything to us, from the supermarket to all the sites we must see and how to get there.<br/>They were there to help us if needed but left us alone to relax and enjoy ourselves.<br/>We will definately go back and stay there, and will recommend it to all our family and friends.<br/>Alessandro runs an amazing business there and is very good at his job, we would recommend it to any of the Plus teachers who are yet to take their holiday.<br/>Thankyou so much to Plus for that great incentive and bonus, we really appreciated every second!<br/>Thanks again,<br/>Johnny and Emilie Katsivelis." .
