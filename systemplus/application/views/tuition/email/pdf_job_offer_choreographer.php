                    Dear <?php echo $recipientName;?>,
                </p>
                <p>
                PLUS Education is pleased to offer you a job as a Choreographer at PLUS Centre this summer.
We hope you will accept the offer and trust that your knowledge, skills and experience will be among our most valuable assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                All current holders of roles involving responsibility for or substantial access to under 18s, and all new appointees to such roles will be required to sign a declaration that they are not barred from working with students under 18.  In accordance with the Company’s Safeguarding and Child Protection Policy, your offer of employment will also be subject to the Company carrying out suitability checks with the Disclosure and Barring Service (in England and Wales); the Protecting Vulnerable Groups Scheme (in Scotland); with Access NI (in Northern Ireland); or with Police ‘Certificate of good conduct’ (outside the UK).
                </p>
                <p>
                This offer is therefore conditional upon the Company receiving an acceptable outcome from your DBS check (or equivalent).  Your employment is also conditional upon you presenting your original ID documents to confirm your eligibility to work. You will also be required to read and confirm your agreement to comply with the Company’s Safeguarding and Child Protection Policy and any other policies that may be applicable to your role. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your title will be <span style="font-weight: bold;border-bottom: 1px solid #000000;">Choreographer</span>.  If you accept this employment offer, you will report to the Campus Manager. 
                </p>
                <p>
                You will be expected to carry out the duties and responsibilities described in the Key Terms and Job Specification document, which I have attached. Alongside the Contract of Employment and the Statement of Personal Terms that will be issued to you, these three documents will set out the terms and conditions of your employment with the Company.
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We anticipate being able to offer you a weekly package of <?php echo $currencySymbol;?>250 - <?php echo $currencySymbol;?>325 per week, paid monthly into your bank account</li>
                    <li>Full board accommodation for the duration of your employment; and</li>
                    <li>A day of training and induction prior to starting your contract</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    87.93% of your weekly package will be paid to you as salary during your employment.  The balance of this package relates to holiday pay.  As the Company is not permitted to roll up holiday pay into your normal salary, if you have not taken any paid holiday during your employment, the balance will be paid to you in lieu of your accrued but untaken holiday entitlement following the termination of your employment with your final salary payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will accrue holiday during the course of your employment.  However, in view of the nature of your work, the Company recognises that you may not be able to take holiday during your employment.  As explained above, if you have not taken any holiday during your employment, the Company will pay the balance of the weekly package that relates to holiday pay that has accrued during your employment at the same time as your final salary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To accept this job offer:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul style="font-weight: bold;">
                    <li>Please email us your official acceptance together with a copy of your DBS check.</li>
                    <li>If you do not have a DBS check or (local equivalent) please complete the enclosed Pre-DBS Declaration and attach it to the acceptance email.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This employment offer is in effect for five working days. This job offer is also made subject to the college obtaining sufficient enrolment numbers.  Whilst we would hope that it will not become necessary to do so, if we do not receive minimum enrolment numbers and thus, the course is not able to run at full capacity, the Company may have no option but to withdraw your offer of employment or if your offer has already been accepted, to terminate your employment without notice.  We will of course give you as much advanced notice of this should this scenario arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We look forward to working with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sincerely,
                </p>
