                    Dear <?php echo $recipientName;?>,

                <p>
                    PLUS Education is pleased to offer you a job as an EFL Teacher at PLUS Centre this summer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope you will accept the offer and trust that your knowledge, skills and experience will be among our most valuable assets.
                </p>
                <p >
                    All current holders of roles involving responsibility for or substantial access to under 18s, and all new appointees to such roles will be required to sign a declaration that they are not barred from working with students under 18.  In accordance with the Company’s Safeguarding and Child Protection Policy, your offer of employment will also be subject to the Company carrying out suitability checks with the Disclosure and Barring Service (in England and Wales); the Protecting Vulnerable Groups Scheme (in Scotland); with Access NI (in Northern Ireland); or with Police ‘Certificate of good conduct’ (outside the UK).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This offer is therefore conditional upon the Company receiving an acceptable outcome from your DBS check (or equivalent).  Your employment is also conditional upon you presenting your original ID documents and original certificates to the Course Director during your induction day to confirm your eligibility to work and that you have the necessary qualifications required for your role. You will also be required to read and confirm your agreement to comply with the Company’s Safeguarding and Child Protection Policy and any other policies that may be applicable to your role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your title will be <span style="font-weight: bold;border-bottom: 1px solid #000000;">EFL Teacher</span> if you accept this employment offer and you will report to the Course Director.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will be expected to carry out the duties and responsibilities described in the Key Terms and Job Specification document, which can be accessed from your personal page on the Company’s systems.  Alongside the Contract of Employment and the Statement of Personal Terms that will be issued to you, these three documents will set out the terms and conditions of your employment with the Company.
                </p>

                        if($wagesType == "Weekly")

                            ?><li>We can offer you a weekly package of <?php echo $currencySymbol;?>320 -340 per week for an average of 15-18 teaching hours per week</li><?php 
                        }
                        else if($wagesType == "Hourly")
                        {
                            ?><li>We can offer you an hour rate of <?php echo $currencySymbol;?> <?php echo $ratePerHour;?> for an average of 15-18 teaching hours per week</li><?php 
                        } */
                    ?>
                    <li>We anticipate being able to offer you <?php echo $currencySymbol;?>850 for 60 teaching hours over two weeks</li>
                    <li>Induction and training on first day of contract, paid at £50; and</li>
                    <li>In the event that you are returning to work for the Company within two (2) years of you having last worked on a summer programme, you will be entitled to a Returner Bonus of <?php echo $currencySymbol;?>50.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    87.93% of your weekly package will be paid to you as salary during your employment.  The balance of this package relates to holiday pay.  As the Company is not permitted to roll up holiday pay into your normal salary, if you have not taken any paid holiday during your employment, the balance will be paid to you in lieu of your accrued but untaken holiday entitlement following the termination of your employment with your final salary payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will accrue holiday during the course of your employment.  However, in view of the nature of your work, the Company recognises that you may not be able to take holiday during your employment.  As explained above, if you have not taken any holiday during your employment, the Company will pay the balance of the weekly package that relates to holiday pay that has accrued during your employment at the same time as your final salary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your salary will be paid monthly directly into your bank account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To accept this job offer:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul style="font-weight: bold;">
                        <li>Please email us your official acceptance.</li>
                        <li>If you do not have a DBS check or (local equivalent) please complete the enclosed Pre-DBS Declaration and attach it to the acceptance email.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This employment offer is in effect for five working days. This job offer is also made subject to the college obtaining sufficient enrolment numbers.  Whilst we would hope that it will not become necessary to do so, if we do not receive minimum enrolment numbers and as a result, the course is not able to run at full capacity, the Company may have no option but to withdraw your offer of employment or if your offer has already been accepted, to terminate your employment without notice.  We will of course give you as much advance notice of this should this scenario arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We look forward to working with you.
