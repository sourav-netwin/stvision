	This Statement dated, <?php echo date('l jS \of F Y') ?> sets out the particulars of main terms of employment under which Professional Linguistic & Upper Studies t/a PLUS LTD, (the employer referred to as 'the Organisation') whose address is 8 Celbridge Mews, London, W2 6EU employs <? echo $nome['nome'] . " " . $nome['cognome']; ?> (referred to as 'employee', 'you', 'your' etc.).<br><br>
	There are no collective agreements affecting your terms and conditions of employment.
	Any changes or amendments to these terms will be confirmed in writing within one month of them occurring.<br><br>
	<strong>Criminal Record Checks<br><br>
	Your employment with the Organisation will be conditional upon receipt of a satisfactory enhanced Criminal Record Bureau (CRB) disclosure. </strong><br><br>
	It will be essential for you to co-operate fully with the application process to obtain future CRB disclosures, as and when required. In addition, you may, at any time, be required to provide a self-disclosure by making a data subject access request in regard to records held on the Police National Computer.<br><br>
	Your ongoing employment in your current role will be subject to the content of the disclosure, or self-disclosure, when it is received, being satisfactory to the Organisation.<br><br>
	<strong>You will bear the cost of this process but be reimbursed on successful completion of employment.</strong><br><br>
	It is a condition of your employment that you notify your Manager immediately if you are questioned or arrested by the police, or charged, cautioned or convicted in connection with any criminal matter. <br><br>
	It is also a condition of your employment that you notify your Manager immediately if you are suspended from work, by any other employer, under the provisions of any legislation that is aimed at protecting children and vulnerable adults.<br><br>
	<strong>Vetting and Barring Schemes and Initiatives</strong><br><br>
	Your future employment in this role is subject to compliance with any future vetting and barring schemes and/or initiatives. <br><br>
	If the appropriate checks are not in place for any reason you must ensure that when working on any of the Organisation’s sites where you have contact with children (defined as those under 16 years or school leaving age) or vulnerable adults, you are accompanied by another member of staff who is a direct employee of that establishment. If this is not possible you must contact your immediate Manager before commencing work.<br><br>
	You will also be required to comply with any reasonable request made by a client of the Organisation that has the aim and objective of promoting the safety and security of children or vulnerable adults. <br><br>
	Any breach of any of these conditions could result in action being taken under the Disciplinary Procedure, which in turn could lead to the termination of your employment.<br><br>

	<strong>Commencement Date</strong><br><br>
	Your period of continuous employment begins on <? echo $datastart; ?><br><br>


<strong>Job Title</strong><br><br>
You are employed as a <strong><? echo $nome['type_contract']  ?></strong>  for a fixed term at <? echo $nome['center_def']; ?>  which will end on <? echo $dataend; ?>.  Either party may terminate this employment within this period by giving the notice detailed in the Notice section.<br><br>
<strong>Place of Work</strong><br/><br/>
Your normal place of work is <? echo $nome['center_def']; ?> but you may be required to work at any of the Organisation's other locations as the Organisation may from time to time require.<br/><br/>
<strong>Working Abroad</strong><br/><br/>
The Organisation does not anticipate a requirement for you to work outside the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>
<strong>Pay</strong><br/><br/>
Your salary will be paid at the rate of <? echo $nome['salary']; ?> &pound; per week (including holiday pay of <? echo $gross_salary; ?>  ) by cheque at fortnightly intervals.<br/><br/>
The Organisation has the right to deduct from your pay, or otherwise to require repayment by other means, any sum which you owe to the Organisation including, without limitation, any overpayment of pay or expenses, loans made to you by the Organisation, or any other item identified in this Statement and/or the Employee Handbook as being repayable by you to the Organisation.<br/><br/>
 
<strong>Accommodation</strong><br/><br/> 
If you are required, for the better performance of your duties, to reside in accommodation allocated to you by the Organisation, it is on the understanding that this is provided under personal licence and you are bound by the terms of the Accommodation Agreement issued to you separately.  Upon the termination of your employment, you must vacate the accommodation immediately. <font color="green">A deduction of &pound; 50 is made per week towards full board for residential teachers and they must vacate the premises on the last day of their contract. <br/>The employer may also make deduction in respect of any costs or expenses incurred by the employer and caused by, or arising from, my occupation of the premises.</font>. <br/><br/>
<strong>Hours of Work</strong><br/><br/>
Your normal hours of work are detailed in the attached addendum “Additional Operational Terms for Teachers”. There may be occasions when you are required to work ‘make up lessons’ this may mean that you will be required to work double the amount of hours than you normally work in a day, however the hours worked in that paid fortnight shall still remain the same.<br/><br/>
<strong>Holiday Entitlement</strong><br/><br/>
In line with the Working Time Regulations, you will receive an additional payment for annual and bank/public holidays in your pay at the agreed rate of 12.07%.<br/><br/>
The additional holiday pay will clearly show on your payslip and the payment will be shown as follows:<br/><br/>
Payment for Working Time 	<? echo $salary-$gross_salary; ?> &pound; per week<br/><br/>
Additional Holiday Pay	  	<? echo $gross_salary; ?> &pound; per week<br/><br/>
Total	                                	<? echo $nome['salary']; ?> &pound; per week<br/><br/>
You are advised to set this money aside as you will not receive any other payment during any  requested holiday periods.Given the nature of the business, it will be necessary for you to work on bank/public holidays as required; these are considered to be part of your normal working week and do not attract any additional payment.<br/><br/>
<strong>Sick Pay</strong><br/><br/>
The procedure you must follow in the event of periods of absence from work due to sickness is set out in the Employee Handbook and the attached addendum.
Payments for periods of absence due to sickness will be made in accordance with the current Statutory Sick Pay Scheme where applicable.<br/><br/>
<strong>Important</strong> If you have been absent due to sickness and are found not to have been genuinely ill, you will be subject to action under the Disciplinary Procedure, which could include dismissal.<br/><br/>
<strong>Pension</strong><br/><br/>
There is no Pension Scheme applicable to your employment.<br/><br/>

<strong>Notice</strong><br/><br/>
 
*You are entitled to receive and are required to give the statutory minimum notice period (1 week after 1 month's service) to terminate your employment.<br/><br/>
 
By mutual agreement, this notice period may be waived. <br/>
The Organisation has the right to terminate your employment without notice or payment in lieu of notice in the case of gross misconduct (a non-exhaustive list of examples of gross misconduct can be found in the Employee Handbook)<br/>
The Organisation reserves the right to require you not to carry out your duties or attend your place of work during the period of notice.<br/>

A Health and Safety handbook is available in the office and at each campus and it is your responsibility to familiarise yourself with these rules and procedures.<br/><br/>
